## Project Description
The Star Wars fan base has continued to grow since its inception in 1977. With the rapidly growing output of Star Wars material along with the increase in mainstream attention, the Star Wars universe can be difficult to understand and connect the dots - especially those new to it. There are resources already available such as Wikipedia, Wookiepeedia, and fan websites, but these seem to be saturated with unnecessary and dense information. This interface offers a clear timeline, character info, and insights to the Star Wars universe that create a familiarity and understanding of the universe in a broader sense.
